# OrderSystem
This system is going to make it easy to make orders and record them. It will allow a person to choose the item to order and if the item is out of stock the pop up message will be displayed telling the person that it is out of stock and it will be ordered again on a particular date. This system will be connected to the database so that every process can be stored for historical reason and the information stored can also be stored to check which product is in demand and which product is not so that the owners of the business can stop buying from the suppliers because it will be a waste of money to continue stocking something that does not make money for the business.
